## Project Goal

Portugal faces the annual challenge of wildfires, a problem with severe environmental and economic impacts. This project was developed to apply data science techniques to better understand this phenomenon.

Cronofogo is an application that not only explores historical wildfire data but also implements a machine learning model to predict the extent of the burned area, serving as a powerful analytical tool.

## Key Features

*   **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface built with Plotly Dash, allowing dynamic data exploration through filters for year, district, and fire cause.
*   **Predictive Model:** Implementation of a Random Forest Regressor to forecast the total burned area based on temporal and geographic features.
*   **In-depth EDA:** A thorough exploratory data analysis of seasonal trends, common causes, and the geographical distribution of fires.
*   **Geospatial Visualizations:** Interactive maps showing the location and scale of fires, making it easy to identify critical areas.
